Write a concise internal update for the ttnn model bringup team. Yesterday we validated the Llama pipeline end to end and fixed a cache indexing bug. Today we want to run a longer teacher forcing eval with a realistic prompt. Summarize the goal in one sentence, then provide two sections: Risks and Plan. In Risks list three bullets: device contention, prompt length exceeding cache, and slow reference generation. In Plan list five bullets: prepare the prompt file, verify token count, run the HF reference, inspect output for coherence, then run the TT model and record top-1 and top-5. Close with a short reminder to keep logs and stop on unexpected behavior.
